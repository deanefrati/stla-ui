# Silly Task List App (STLA)
Silly Task List App (STLA) is an example project used for educational purpose. It's used to demonstrate how to create web applications in variouse different programing languages.
By recreating the same application in different languages you can easily see the difference between each language and it's web application frameworks.

By no means is this project intended to give any advise about which language  is best or most prefered, I leave that up to the consumers who are trying to find the best web application platform for their project.

I use this project as a learning opportunity for myself and don't presume to have the best knowledge about any of the languages used, i'm sure others can write better code and levarage language or platform specific features better. I encurage anyone to contribute and improve uppon this project.

# About the application
STLA is a simple web application allowing users to create and manage simple tasks. It has 3 main views:
* Active Tasks view:
  Let users see their current active tasks, mark them as done and add new tasks.
* Historic Tasks view:
  Let users see their completed historical tasks.
* Single Task view:
  Let users get more details about a specific task as well as add comments to it if it's active.

This is a very simple use case but shows the basic features of a modern web application.

# About this specific repo
This repo is a UI only view of the simple STLA application. The UI is written using typical web languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript and levarages [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org).
This repo serves as the base for other specific server side language implementations so we can easily see how different languages can be used to power the application.
